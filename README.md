## 📖 About The Project

The Retail Data Warehouse & Analytics Suite is an end-to-end data engineering and business intelligence solution designed to process, store, and analyze high-volume retail transactional data.

The project solves the challenge of deriving actionable business insights from raw CSV logs. It implements a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to populate a PostgreSQL data warehouse and utilizes advanced SQL scripting to generate key performance indicators (KPIs), such as Year-Over-Year growth, customer lifecycle value, and inventory cost segmentation.
